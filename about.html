<h1>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. </h1>
<p>Sandy beaches occupy about one third of global coastlines.[2] These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural rolesâ€”often driving local tourism industries. To support these uses, some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. 
<br>
<br>
<p>Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed for tourism or recreation. Preserved beaches are important biomes with important roles in aquatic or marine biodiversity, such as for breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins.
